RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 22.05

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 22.05 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 20.11 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 20.11 or 21.08 to version 22.05 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

All SPANK plugins must be recompiled when upgrading from any Slurm version
prior to 22.05.

NOTE: PMIx v1.x is no longer supported.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- The template slurmrestd.service unit file now defaults to listen on both the
    Unix socket and the slurmrestd port.
 -- The template slurmrestd.service unit file now defaults to enable auth/jwt and
    the munge unit is no longer a dependency by default.
 -- Add extra 'EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/$service' setting to service files.
 -- Allow jobs to pack onto nodes already rebooting with the desired features.
 -- Reset job start time after nodes are rebooted, previously only done for
    cloud/power save boots.
 -- Node features (if any) are passed to RebootProgram if run from slurmctld.
 -- Fail srun when using invalid --cpu-bind options (e.g. --cpu-bind=map_cpu:99
    when only 10 cpus are allocated).
 -- Storing batch scripts and env vars are now in indexed tables using
    substantially less disk space.  Those storing scripts in 21.08 will all
    be moved and indexed automatically.
 -- Run MailProg through slurmscriptd instead of directly fork+exec()'ing
    from slurmctld.
 -- Add acct_gather_interconnect/sysfs plugin.
 -- Future and Cloud nodes are treated as "Planned Down" in usage reports.
 -- Add new shard plugin for sharing gpus but not with mps.
 -- Add support for Lenovo SD650 V2 in acct_gather_energy/xcc plugin.
 -- Remove cgroup_allowed_devices_file.conf, since the default policy in modern
    kernels is to whitelist by default. Denying specific devices must be done
    through gres.conf.
 -- Node state flags (DRAIN, FAILED, POWERING UP, etc.) will be cleared now if
    node state is updated to FUTURE.
 -- Add support to update all the nodes in the local cluster when the nodelist
    expression in the update node message is "ALL" (i.e. 'scontrol update
    NodeName=ALL').

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see man appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- AcctGatherEnergyType 'rsmi' is now 'gpu'.
 -- TaskAffinity parameter was removed from cgroup.conf.
 -- Fatal if the mutually-exclusive JobAcctGatherParams options of UsePss and
    NoShared are both defined.
 -- KeepAliveTime has been moved into CommunicationParameters. The standalone
    option will be removed in a future version.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- Remove support for (non-functional) --cpu-bind=boards.
 -- Added --prefer option at job submission to allow for 'soft' constraints.
 -- Add "condflags=open" to sacctmgr show events to return open/currently down
    events.
 -- sacct -f flag implies -c flag.

API CHANGES
===========
 -- openapi/v0.0.35 - Plugin has been removed.
 -- burst_buffer plugins - err_msg added to bb_p_job_validate().
